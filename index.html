            TheConversation is a multimedia platform that helps life long learners find credible, trustworthy content created by academics. The Conversation combines academic rigor with journalistic flair. It is a destination to many curious learners worldwide for high-quality information about current affairs, science, art, and culture.
            
            Even though TheConversation is an excellent source of high quality content, we recognized some room for improvement in its design and content organization. The original platform seems to be very crowded, and it makes it hard to find articles that people may enjoy based on their interest. So that was our starting point in re-imagining TheConversation.</p>

            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>

            <p>We conducted 4 interviews to learn about ways in which people engage with multimedia platforms like TheConversation. We wanted to know mainly about the pain points they experience.<p>

            <p>And we have learned that people struggle with </p>

              <p><b>01</b> the credibility of information they engage with<p>
              <p><b>02</b> limited time for learning<p>
              <p><b>03</b> disorganized content they often encounter<p>
              <p><b>04</b> mistrust of the expertise of the authors<p>
              <p><b>05</b> lack of personally relevant format of learning and content<p>
              <p><b>06</b> poor and distracting design<p>

              <p><b>02</b> content focused on their preferred way of learning<p>

            <p>
              Many curious learners worldwide want to consume high-quality information about science, current affairs, art, and culture, but they are often bombarded with distracting ads and disorganized, personally irrelevant, poorly designed, and lengthy content.
              
              How might we ensure our readers are confident in getting credible information, learning the way they prefer, and are able to share that information with others?

              <p>It would be fascinating to explore and develop further other features that were considered important for our life-long learners:</p>

              <p><b>01</b> sharing content with family and friends</p>
              <p><b>02</b> highlighting the expertise of and trust in the writers</p>
              <p><b>03</b> highlighting the credibility of the content (fact checking)</p>
              <p><b>04</b> building our “personalised library” feature further</p>
              <p><b>05</b> and focusing on minimal design</p>
